\problem

{\large How do you know if all the cameras are rolling?
 \par}

Look and listen for the signs and signals. 


\solution

{\large Look for the flashing red firefly lights. 


 \par}

You can tell if all the cameras were triggered after you start each take by checking the red LED status indicator lights. They will continue to flash while they are recording so you can tell if a camera failed or cuts out. 

Double triple check the settings on all the cameras before shooting and in between takes. The cameras sometimes change settings when knocked. There is a lot happening on set or on the road and things get out of sync. If an LED is broken, you can check the LCD monitor on the cameras. The cameras will show the runtime on the take when they are rolling.
