beep



\solution

{\large Welcome the beeps. Or turn them off. \par}

The constant beeping can be quite maddening whenever you are adjusting the default settings on all the cameras. Instead, reprogram your brain to receive positive feedback that the cameras are working. Use the beeps as sound indicators, that a take has begun or a camera has stopped rolling. Then the beeps only drive everyone else crazy and you will have perfect memory pitch of 659 Hz, which is an E5.
